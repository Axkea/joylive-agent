/**
 * The {@code VariableParser} interface defines the contract for parsing variables from various sources within a service request.
 * Implementations of this interface can parse variables based on different types such as method invocations, HTTP parameters,
 * or expressions.
 * <p>
 * This interface is designed to be extensible, allowing for custom implementations that can handle additional types
 * or parsing strategies. It supports generic types {@code T} and {@code S} to allow for flexibility in the types of requests
 * and variable sources it can work with.
 * <p>
 * The {@code parse} method is the core method that needs to be implemented, which takes a request and a source, returning
 * the parsed variable as a {@code String}. There is also a default implementation of the {@code parse} method that accepts
 * a {@code VariableFunction} to further process the parsed variable.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of the service request from which variables are to be parsed.
 * @param <S> The type of the variable source that provides the variables to be parsed.
 * @see ServiceRequest
 * @see VariableSource
 * @see VariableFunction
