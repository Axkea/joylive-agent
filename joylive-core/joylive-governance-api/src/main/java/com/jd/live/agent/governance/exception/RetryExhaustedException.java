 * Indicates that an operation has exceeded the maximum number of retry attempts without success.

 * This exception is thrown in scenarios where retry logic is applied to an operation, and the operation
 * continues to fail after the maximum number of retries has been reached. It serves as a clear indicator
 * that all attempts to retry the operation have been exhausted, and further action may be required to
 * handle the failure. This could involve logging the failure, alerting an administrator, or triggering
 * alternative recovery mechanisms.
