/**
 * Represents a combinator for {@link ElementMatcher} instances, allowing for logical operations

 * {@code ElementMatcher} and provides additional methods for combining matchers in a fluent
 * and expressive manner.
 * <p>
 * The {@code Junction} interface is useful when complex matching conditions need to be
 * composed from simpler ones. It enables the creation of compound matchers that can
 * evaluate to true only if all (AND) or any (OR) of their component matchers evaluate to true.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface must provide the logic for the {@code and} and {@code or}
 * methods to combine matchers according to the specified logical operations.
