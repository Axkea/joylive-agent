/**
 * Represents a functional interface for matching elements based on custom criteria.
 * This interface is designed to be implemented by classes that specify the logic
 * for matching elements of type {@code T}. The primary method {@code match} determines
 * whether a given element satisfies the matching criteria.
 * <p>
 * {@code ElementMatcher} is a key component in systems where elements (such as classes,
 * methods, fields, etc.) need to be filtered or selected based on specific conditions.
 * It provides a generic and flexible way to define these conditions.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface are expected to provide a boolean result indicating
 * whether the provided element matches the defined criteria. This makes {@code ElementMatcher}
 * suitable for a wide range of matching scenarios.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of element to be matched
